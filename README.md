This repository holds the data and code 
used in manuscript "A Comparative Study of
Yield Monitor Data Processing Methods for On-Farm
Agronomic Trials". 

## Data description

on-farm trail conducted by the [Data-Intensive Farm
Management (DIFM)](https://difm.farm/) project.
The yield monitor geometries have been anonymized
and centered around Ames, Iowa (-93.62037,
